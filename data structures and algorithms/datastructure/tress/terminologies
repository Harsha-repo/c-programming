tree is a noon linear data structure .
itis used to represent the heirarchial data . 

root = topmost node.
parent = node which connects to the child.
child = node which is connected by another node is its child.
leaf = nodes with no children.
internal node : nodes with atleast one children.
depth = no of  edges from root to the node .
height = no of edges from node to the rootnode.
depth = no of edges from node to the deepest leafsibllings : nodes belonging to the same parent.


binary tree =  is a tree whose having maximum of two children per node .
n nodes -> n-1 edges .
degree = no of direct children to a node .
degree of a tree = the maximum number of cildren to a node. 

types of binary tress :
full bt = all nodes are having maximum of 2 children not more tahn that  . 0,1,2
perfectbt = all nodes must should have the 2 children and all leafs are at the same level 
complete bt = all noddes have maximum of 2 children and there is one extra leaf node as left as posible to the tree.
degenerate tree = is the tree that has only one children for every  node
skewed tree: onlly one side of the tree is continued either left or right 
right skewed or left skewed respectively
