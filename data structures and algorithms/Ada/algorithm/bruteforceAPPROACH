BRUTE FORCE APPROACH:  it is approach where we traverse the give datastructure completely 
it is an approach where the alogorithm meets all different methods or options or scenarios untill the solution is found

because of the high temporal complexity we see that they become slow when it comes the larger inputs 

different sorting methods using BF approch are 
1.selection sort
2.bubble sort
3.sequential search
