A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving technique that makes the best local choice at each step in the hope of finding the global optimum solution. It prioritizes immediate benefits over long-term consequences, making decisions based on the current situation without considering future implications. While this approach can be efficient and straightforward, it doesnâ€™t guarantee the best overall outcome for all problems

Characteristics of Greedy Algorithm
Here are the characteristics of a greedy algorithm:

Greedy algorithms are simple and easy to implement.
They are efficient in terms of time complexity, often providing quick solutions.
Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.
These algorithms do not reconsider previous choices, as they make decisions based on current information without looking ahead.
Greedy algorithms are suitable for problems for optimal substructure.
